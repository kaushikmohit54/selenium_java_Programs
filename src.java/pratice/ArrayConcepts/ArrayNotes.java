	//Array is a Special Variable, we can perform different types of operations on data like
	//adding of elements, deleting of elements and printing them.
	//Array is Index Based. 
	//We can use For-Loop to Print Values of Array. Since For-Loop is also Index Based.
	
	//Static Array - Size is Fixed.
	//int i[] = new int[5];
	//We get ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException. If we try to access out of Array Size.
		
	//Object Array - Using Object Array we can store all kind of Data Type variables.
	//But Size is fixed with it as well.
